# Task Kanban Board

## Description

This code creates a kanban board that can be filled with tasks and organized into three lanes depending on their current status. The code was provided by Benjamin Machock and I parsed through the code to include comments to ensure I understood what the code was doing for the webpage. This helped me gain knowledge on how to call other functions within a function and pass variables around for use in multiple functions.
